- 2026-10-18: Step plans for both backends moved to `src/core/restore_steps.*`
  with tests pinning the step count and first destructive step. The helper
  announces its plan and app version (protocol 3), and the GUI refuses a
  mismatched helper. CI passes on Windows and Linux, and a restore with the
  installed package is tested and confirmed working. Ships in 1.6.1.

- 2026-10-18: Added a `.deb` built by CPack through `scripts/build-deb.sh`, with
  the helper at `/usr/libexec/usb-restoration-helper` and its polkit action. CI
  builds, checks and installs it; releases attach it. Installing it and restoring
  through pkexec is tested and confirmed working. No other package formats are
  planned; the `.deb` and AppImage cover Linux.

- 2026-10-18: The Linux helper catches `SIGPIPE`/`SIGHUP`, and both backends
  confirm the disk again after the partition table is written and before
  formatting. SECURITY.md updated to match. Tested and confirmed working on both
  platforms.

- 2026-10-18: Clarified cancellation feedback about remounting and drive letters.
  Windows Release build and core tests passed.
- 2026-10-18: Consolidated documentation into `docs/`, removed the Obsidian vault,
  hardware-test log and signing guide, and shortened the README. Retired hardware
  coverage tasks following confirmation of testing across devices and systems.

Release history is in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md). Design boundaries and
intentional exclusions are in [polkit-helper.md](polkit-helper.md) and
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
